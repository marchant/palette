Montage Authoring Toolkit

These are the low-level pieces that could be assembled into a fully-fledged
montage editor.

If working on the palette library itself you'll need the development
dependencies:

    npm install

Otherwise, runtime dependencies are typically expected to be provided by a
host environment.

The editing context provided by the EditingFrame component can be seen within
the palette.html file; no UI is provided in this particular example.
